# CCTV Service Application - Backend API

This is the backend server for a CCTV Service Web Application. It manages the workflow for CCTV installations, repairs, and maintenance. The system utilizes a role-based architecture (Customer, Agent, Admin) to facilitate service requests, assignment logic, and status updates.

> **Status:** 🚧 *Partially Completed / In Development*
>
> This project is currently in the prototype stage. Authentication, request management, and image handling are implemented. Payment processing and GPS integration are planned for future releases.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Runtime:** Node.js
* **Framework:** Express.js
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Authentication:** JSON Web Token (JWT) & OTP (via D7 Networks)
* **File Storage:** Cloudinary (with Multer)
* **SMS Provider:** D7Sms

## ✨ Key Features

### Authentication & Roles
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Three distinct roles: `Admin`, `Agent`, and `Customer`.
* **OTP Login:** Secure login system using One-Time Passwords sent to user mobile numbers via D7Sms.
* **JWT:** Stateless session management.

### Workflow
1.  **Customer:**
    * Can login/register via OTP.
    * Can request services (New Installation, Repair, or Maintenance).
    * Can upload images regarding the issue (stored via Cloudinary).
2.  **Admin:**
    * Views incoming requests from customers.
    * Assigns requests to specific Agents.
    * Handles re-assignment if an Agent rejects a request.
3.  **Agent:**
    * Receives job assignments.
    * **Accept/Reject Logic:** Agents can accept a job to start processing or reject it (returning it to the pool for the Admin to re-assign).
    * Updates the status of the work (e.g., In Progress, Completed).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Node.js (v14+ recommended)
* PostgreSQL installed and running locally or via a cloud provider.
* Accounts for [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) and [D7 Networks](https://d7networks.com/).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Environment Configuration:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:
    ```env
    PORT=5000
    NODE_ENV=development

    # Database
    DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/cctv_db

    # JWT Config
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key
    JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d

    # Cloudinary Config (Image Storage)
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

    # D7 SMS Config (OTP)
    D7_API_KEY=your_d7_api_key
    D7_API_SECRET=your_d7_api_secret
    ```

4.  **Run the Server:**
    ```bash
    # For development (using nodemon)
    npm run dev

    # For production
    npm start
    ```

## 🗺 Roadmap & Future Implementation

The following features are planned but **not yet implemented**:

* **Payment Gateway Integration:** Secure payment processing for service charges.
